                <h4>Guide to Kak2R's Mission Item Tool for theHunter Classic</h4>
                <GuideUL>
                    <li>
                        This tool presents mission information in a highly accessible way & help players maximise their in-game currency earnings from missions
                        by showing them the most profitable items to buy, personalised according to what a player has already bought. In a nutshell, click on
                        the items that you have already purchased on the left & you'll be shown what you can earn from other items. You can also easily keep
                        track of the missions you are on by using the bookmarking feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hover over an item on the left to show missions that must use it or can use it. "Uses" is the number of those missions.</li>
                    <li>
                        Click on an item to count it as 'purchased' & see what missions will be unlocked. The earnings of unselected items will be recalculated
                        every time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Earns" is the extra unlocked amount which you will currently be able to earn from having that item, both from the accessible missions
                        requiring it & from the missions after it which were already ready. It flashes if the amount is greater than the cost of the item, and
                        its value depends on what other items you have already clicked. The amount does not include rewards from later missions which also
                        require the item but which are blocked by the unfulfilled requirements of a previous mission. Those will be included in the earnings of
                        future items. Remember that an item purchased now might not help you complete any missions, but when purchased later after other items,
                        can open up many. This tool can be used to find an optimal 'purchasing pathway'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Asterisked (*) items are non-essential - they <em>can</em> be used to complete some missions, but it's possible to complete all missions
                        without them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hover over the mission rewards to see objectives & required items. Click on a mission reward to 'bookmark' that mission as the currently
                        active mission in the mission pack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hover over a mission pack name to see its total gm$. Click on it to select/deselect all the items <em>absolutely</em> required for that
                        pack. Requirements that state "either this item or that" are left to you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can hide mission packs by hovering over the title & clicking the <HideIcon height={17} fill={theme.fontColor} /> icon. This will
                        update everything as if it doesn't exist.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mainly for desktop use, but if you are viewing on a phone, tap & hold briefly to 'hover'.</li>

                <NotesUL>
                    <li> This tool assumes that you already have the .243 rifle, 4x32mm scope, 12GA single shot shotgun & ground blind.</li>
                    <li> For Red Kangaroo mission 10 I have only specified scopes which all the Ansch√ºtz rifles can use.</li>
                    <li>
                        B&C Club mission 5 requires you use any scoped weapon for a moose. As there are many possibilities here, I have not bothered accounting
                        for it - so this tool assumes you will already have something suitable by then. Highly probable. (The most inexpensive choices are the
                        .30-06 Stutzen, .300 or .340 Weatherby, the only moose permitted rifles that can take the 4x32mm starting scope.)
